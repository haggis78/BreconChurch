                                <p>Origin unknown. This is the principal copy consulted by Edward
                                    Yardley in compiling _Menevia Sacra_. This can be determined by
                                    the fact that the page numbers he supplies in his marginal
                                    notations (rendered as footnotes in the publication by editor
                                    Francis Green) align with the page numbers in this manuscript.
                                    Yardley's partial transcript of the Brecon charter on p. 415 of
                                    _Menevia Sacra_ references "Ex libro Episcopi Menev., Stat.
                                    Menev., p. 269. Compare this with ye same Charter printed in B.
                                    Willis, Abb. Vol. ii, p. 304." The document in question begins
                                    on p. 269 in this manuscript. More fully, Yardley's digest of
                                    the statutes (National Library of Wales, MS SDCh/B/31, not
                                    published by Green) has page references throughout, which again
                                    align with the page numbers in this manuscript. This is our only
                                    indication of this manuscript's date. Yardley began his
                                    researches in 1739 and appears to have completed the main
                                    substance of _Menevia Sacra_ around the mid-1740s, though he
                                    continued to add new members to his lists of canons and
                                    dignitaries until the early 1760s (_Menevia Sacra_, p. iv;
                                    National Library of Wales, MS. SDCh/B/30). It is likely that he
                                    was alredy using this manuscript in the 1740s; the latest
                                    possible terminus ante quem is 1769, the year in which Yardley
                                    died. <origDate>Probably before 1746.</origDate>, </p>

                                <p>Origin unknown. Two letters are pasted in among foreleaves. One
                                    from Bishop Adam Ottley (bishop of St Davids 1713-23) mentions
                                    borrowing a copy of the Statutes from Robert Harley, 1st Earl of
                                    Oxford, though this may in fact refer to the MS that is now
                                    Harley 6280, which Ottley used to check National Library of
                                    Wales, MS SDCh/B/22 in 1719. The other is from his successor,
                                    Richard Smallbrook (bishop of St Davids 1724-1731) in 1729,
                                    promising to return to Edward Harley, 2nd Earl of Oxford, a copy
                                    of the statutes (either Harley 6280 or this present volume)
                                    which he had borrowed to use in a suit in the Court of Arches to
                                    oblige canons of St Davids to residence. Harley 6280 was in the
                                    hands of Thomas Baker at Cambridge at an unknown date between
                                    1719 and his death in 1740 (Bodleian Library, Willis MS. 38 f.
                                    531r-v), and may not have entered Harley's collection yet. It may be that Harley 1249 was thus the only copy
                                    Harley had to lend to Smallbrook at this time. Moreover, Smallbrook would have recognized that Harley 6280 properly belonged to the cathedral chapter, while Harley 1249 bears no marks that it belonged to anyone other than Harley; thanks for a loan with a promise to return a book would make sense if the book was 1249 but not 6280.
