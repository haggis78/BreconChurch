                  <note>This is the earliest known printing. In a footnote Willis writes 'So in the transcript'. This indicates that he did not have the original Letters Patent in front of him but was working from a transcript supplied to him. His papers in the Bodleian Library in Oxtord (classmark MS Willis) contain thousands of items of drafts and correspondence bound into more than 100 volumes. The transcript from which he worked very likely survives there but has not been located for purposes of this project.</note>

                        <p>Origin unknown. This is the principal copy consulted by Edward
                           Yardley in compiling _Menevia Sacra_. This can be determined by
                           the fact that the page numbers he supplies in his marginal
                           notations (rendered as footnotes in the publication by editor
                           Francis Green) align with the page numbers in this manuscript.
                           Yardley's partial transcript of the Brecon charter on p. 415 of
                           _Menevia Sacra_ references 'Ex libro Episcopi Menev., Stat.
                           Menev., p. 269. Compare this with ye same Charter printed in B.
                           Willis, Abb. Vol. ii, p. 304.' (The printing to which Yardley refers is our Witness W.) The document in question begins
                           on p. 269 in only one manuscript, indicating that Yardley was referring to this copy. More fully, Yardley's digest of
                           the statutes (National Library of Wales, MS SDCh/B/31, not
                           published by Green) has page references throughout, which again
                           align with the page numbers in this manuscript. A note on p. iii of Yardley's digest is our only
                           indication of this manuscript's date: he wrote  that it was 'Abridg'd from a Copy of ye Statutes in the Possession of ye Rt Revd Nicholas [Clagett] Ld Bp of St Davids, lent me by his Lordship, May 1740'.<origDate>Before May 1740.</origDate>.

                        <p>Origin unknown. Two letters are pasted in among foreleaves. One
                           from Bishop Adam Ottley (bishop of St Davids 1713-23) mentions
                           borrowing a copy of the Statutes from Robert Harley, 1st Earl of
                           Oxford. This may in fact refer to the MS that is now
                           Harley 6280, though that seems unlikely. Ottley used Harley 6280 to check National Library of
                           Wales, MS SDCh/B/22 in 1719, but it is not clear that Harley had come into possession of that manuscript yet. The other letter is from his successor,
                           Richard Smallbrook (bishop of St Davids 1724-1731) in 1729,
                           promising to return to Edward Harley, 2nd Earl of Oxford, a copy
                           of the statutes (either Harley 6280 or this present volume)
                           which he had borrowed to use in a suit in the Court of Arches to
                           oblige canons of St Davids to residence. Harley 6280 was in the
                           hands of Thomas Baker at Cambridge at an unknown date between
                           1719 and his death in 1740 (Bodleian Library, Willis MS. 38 f.
                           531r-v), and again, it may not have entered Harley's collection yet. It may be that Harley 1249 was thus the only copy
                           Harley had to lend to Smallbrook at this time. Moreover, both Ottley and Smallbrook should have recognized that Harley 6280 properly belonged to the cathedral chapter, while Harley 1249 bears no marks that it belonged to anyone other than Harley. A letter of thanks for a loan with a promise to return a book would make sense if the book was 1249 but not 6280.
                           <origDate>Probably before 1729.</origDate></p>

                        <p>Produced by Chancery, the office that issued and enrolled Letters Patent. The 'original' from which it was copied was not the Letter Patent that had been issued, but rather the Warrant in Chancery, the authorised draft from which the Letter itself was prepared. This may survive in The National Archives in the file C 82/776, which contains the surviving Warrants in Chancery for January of 32 Henry VIII (1541), but we have not been able to examine it at this time. Though the Letters Patent establishing Brecon were issued in January of 32 Henry VIII (1540 Old Style, 1541 New Style), the document was not enrolled in the Patent Rolls until 33 Henry VIII, confirming that it must have been copied from the Warrant in Chancery, which they would still have had, and not the Letters Patent, which had already been sent out (for details of the process, see https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015008927983&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=1). The Patent Rolls were initially stored in the Rolls Chapel in the
                           Tower of London. The were then moved to the new Public Record Office building
                           in Chancery Lane in the 1850s and thence to the second Public
                           Record Office building in Kew in the 1990s. The Public Record
                           Office became The National Archives in 2003. <origDate>
