        <div class="index">
            <p class="index">This is a digitally-based project that uses XML to encode the documents related to the foundation of Brecon Collegiate Church and School in 1541. The project also aims to perform a manuscript collation on the varying copies of the official government copy of the Letter Patent detailing the move of the Collegiate Church.</p>
