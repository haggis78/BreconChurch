            Note in pen on f. ii r: "It appearing by an Attestation wrote
            over against the first Page of the Statute-Book of this
            Cathedral Church [now N.L.W., SDCh/B/22] that in the year 1719
            the said Statute-Book was collated by the late Bishop Ottley
            &amp; the late Mr. Chantor Davies with a much more ancient
            manuscript of the said Statutes [now British Library, Harley MS
            6280], which was attested A[nn]o 1588 by Bishop Middleton,
            Chantor Huett &amp; c., &amp; which said ancient Copy has ever
            since been unfortunately missing (which is greatly lamented) or
            at least was never seen by any of the present members of the
            Chapter; -Richard Davies Archdeacon of St. Davids &amp; one of
            the Canons Residentiary of this Church made many Enquiries with
            various Persons and in various places, in order to the
            recovering, if possible, the said ancient manuscript: and
            particularly haveing procured diligent search to be made for
            that purpose among the Books and Papers of the said late Mr.
            Chantor Davies, altho' the Book in question could not, upon such
            serch, be found, yet the present manuscript (containing not only
            the St. Davids Statutes, but also the Patent of King Henry the
            Eighth for founding Christ's College in Brecon) being met with
            among the said Books, was, at the Request of the said
            Archdeacon, generously made a Present of to the Chantor and
            Chapter of St. Davids by the Reverend Mr. Richard Davies Master
            of Arts, Golden Prebendary of this Church [NB he held the preb.
            of Mathrey, alias the Golden Prebend, form 1723 to his d. in May
            1745], on order to be laid up in the Chapter-Chest of this
            Cathedral, where it is accordingly deposited this 25th day of
            July in the Year one thousand seven hundred and forty eight by
            me Richard Davies Archdeacon of St. Davids." [pencil note
            below:] "Qu. whether this is in the British Museum."
            Before 14 Dec. 1732, when Precentor
            (Chantor) John Davies died. Remains in the legal ownership of
            the Dean and Chapter of St Davids; placed on deposit at National
            Library of Wales.

            Origin unknown. This is the principal copy consulted by Edward
            Yardley in compiling _Menevia Sacra_. This can be determined by
            the fact that the page numbers he supplies in his marginal
            notations (rendered as footnotes in the publication by editor
            Francis Green) align with the page numbers in this manuscript.
            Yardley's partial transcript of the Brecon charter on p. 415 of
            _Menevia Sacra_ references "Ex libro Episcopi Menev., Stat.
            Menev., p. 269. Compare this with ye same Charter printed in B.
            Willis, Abb. Vol. ii, p. 304." The document in question begins
            on p. 269 in this manuscript. More fully, Yardley's digest of
            the statutes (National Library of Wales, MS SDCh/B/31, not
            published by Green) has page references throughout, which again
            align with the page numbers in this manuscript. This is our only
            indication of this manuscript's date. Yardley began his
            researches in 1739 and appears to have completed the main
            substance of _Menevia Sacra_ around the mid-1740s, though he
            continued to add new members to his lists of canons and
            dignitaries until the early 1760s (_Menevia Sacra_, p. iv;
            National Library of Wales, MS. SDCh/B/30). It is likely that he
            was alredy using this manuscript in the 1740s; the latest
            possible terminus ante quem is 1770, the year in which Yardley
            died. Probably before 1746.,

            Origin unknown. Two letters are pasted in among foreleaves. One
            from Bishop Adam Ottley (bishop of St Davids 1713-23) mentions
            borrowing a copy of the Statutes from Robert Harley, 1st Earl of
            Oxford, though this may in fact refer to the MS that is now
            Harley 6280, which Ottley used to check National Library of
            Wales, MS SDCh/B/22 in 1719. The other is from his successor,
            Richard Smallbrook (bishop of St Davids 1724-1731) in 1729,
            promising to return to Edward Harley, 2nd Earl of Oxford, a copy
            of the statutes (either Harley 6280 or this present volume)
            which he had borrowed to use in a suit in the Court of Arches to
            oblige canons of St Davids to residence. Harley 6280 was in the
            hands of Thomas Baker at Cambridge at an unknown date between
            1719 and his death in 1740 (Bodleian Library, Willis MS. 38 f.
            531r-v), and may not have entered Harley's collection yet. It may be that Harley 1249
            was thus the only copy
            Harley had to lend to Smallbrook at this time. Moreover, Smallbrook would have recognized
            that Harley 6280 properly belonged to the cathedral chapter, while Harley 1249 bears
            no marks that it belonged to anyone other than Harley; thanks for a loan with a promise
            to return a book would make sense if the book was 1249 but not 6280.
            Probably before 1729.,
