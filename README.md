# BreconChurch

You are welcome to peruse our code.

This Github repo contains the files for our DH project on Henry VIII's Letters Patent founding Brecon Collegiate Church and School in Wales in the year 1541.

This project was conceived with several goals in mind. It was a joint student-faculty project for the Digital Humanities class taught by Dr. Elisa Beshero-Bondar at the University of Pittsburgh-Greensburg in the fall of 2019. First, then, it was a source of material with which to work as we learned coding skills.

Second, it was a case study. Most of the manuscripts that carry the text we studied carry it only as an appendix to a much longer text: the medieval Statutes of St Davids Cathedral in Wales. Any attempt to edit that longer text, a scholarly task that is overdue, will have to make use of these manuscripts. By comparing their texts carefully, we can arrive at hypotheses as to their relationships (who copied from whom).

We chose to use the TEI framework instead of writing our own schema. This is because the TEI was designed for precisely the sort of work that we were doing, and it made far more sense to adopt an existing standard than to try to re-invent the wheel. This will be even more important if and when a study of the St Davids Statutes ensues.

Thank you for visiting our site.
