        <h1>Project Team</h1>
        
        <p>The Christ Church Brecon project was a joint student-professor effort as a project for a Digital Humanities class at the University of Pittsburgh-Greensburg in the fall of 2019, taught by Dr. Elisa Beshero-Bondar.</p>
        
        <p><b>Dr. William Campbell</b> has taught History at the University of Pittsburgh-Greensburg since 2008. His publications include two volumes in the series <em>Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae</em>, the biographical register of the English and Welsh cathedral clergy from 1066 to 1857. His work on the final volume of the series, <em>The Welsh Cathedrals, 1541-1857</em> (forthcoming from the Institute of Historical Research), brought him into contact with the manuscripts of the Statutes of St Davids Cathedral, some of which include the Letters Patent founding Christ College Brecon as an appendix. Despite a background in Latin and manuscript studies, this is his first foray into the world of DH, and he was a much a student as his colleagues on the team.</p>

        <p>The members of Team Brecon are also pleased to record their gratitude to fellow Pitt-Greensburg students Alyssa Argento, who assisted greatly with web design and XSLT composition, and Jonah Jankovich, Dr. Campbell's research assistant on the Welsh <em>Fasti</em> project, who prepared the initial transcript from Witness W which greatly streamlined the coding process for the rest of us. We are also grateful for the teaching and direction of Dr. Elisa Beshero-Bondar and the Center for the Digital Text at the University of Pittsburgh-Greensburg.</p>
