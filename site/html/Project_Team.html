            <h1>Project Team</h1>

            <p>The Christ Church Brecon project was a joint student-professor effort as a project
                for a Digital Humanities class at the University of Pittsburgh-Greensburg in the
                fall of 2019, taught by Dr. Elisa Beshero-Bondar.</p>

            <p><b>Dr. William Campbell</b> has taught History at the University of
                Pittsburgh-Greensburg since 2008. His publications include two volumes in the series
                    <em>Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae</em>, the biographical register of the English
                and Welsh cathedral clergy from 1066 to 1857. His work on the final volume of the
                series, <em>The Welsh Cathedrals, 1541-1857</em> (forthcoming from the Institute of
                Historical Research), brought him into contact with the manuscripts of the Statutes
                of St Davids Cathedral, some of which include the Letters Patent founding Christ
                College Brecon as an appendix. Despite a background in Latin and manuscript studies,
                this is his first foray into the world of DH, and he was a much a student as his
                colleagues on the team.</p>

            <p><b>Amber M. Peddicord</b> is an undergraduate student studying English Literature and
                Communication at the University of Pittsburgh-Greensburg. She is currently a junior,
                and is also working toward a <a
                    href="https://www.greensburg.pitt.edu/academics/majors-minors/digital-studies"
                    >Digital Studies Certificate.</a> In the past year, Amber has been brought into
                the DH world both as a student and as a research assistant working under the
                direction of Dr. Elisa Beshero-Bondar on the <a href="https://digitalmitford.org/"
                    >Digital Mitford Project</a>. She is very new to the world of coding but is glad
                to be working with such a great team to learn and apply her skills to the Brecon
                Project.</p>

            <p><b>Connor R. Chinoy</b> is an undergraduate History student at the University of
                Pittsburgh-Greensburg. He is currently in his fourth year, and is also working on a
                Digital Studies Certificate as well as an <a
                    href="https://www.greensburg.pitt.edu/academics/majors-minors/applied-research"
                    >Applied Research minor</a>. This semester has been his first experience with
                DH, as well as with coding in general, which he hopes to apply to his own archival
                collections in the field of railroad history and preservation. He is glad to be
                working both with Dr. Campbell and Amber on the Brecon Project, and with Dr. Greg
                Bondar as a surveying assistant for another Humanities department project at
                Pitt-Greensburg, the <a href="https://wovdighistory.psc.edu/contributors">West
                    Overton Village project.</a></p>

            <p>The members of Team Brecon are also pleased to record their gratitude to fellow
                Pitt-Greensburg students Alyssa Argento, who assisted greatly with web design and
                XSLT composition, and Jonah Jankovich, Dr. Campbell's research assistant on the
                Welsh <em>Fasti</em> project, who prepared the initial transcript from Witness W
                which greatly streamlined the coding process for the rest of us. We are also
                grateful for the teaching and direction of Dr. Elisa Beshero-Bondar and the Center
                for the Digital Text at the University of Pittsburgh-Greensburg.</p>
