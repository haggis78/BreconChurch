            <h1>History of Brecon Church</h1>
        <h2>Background:</h2>
        <p>When King Henry VIII was reorganizing the English church after the Reformation, he closed down all of the monasteries and took their property. Some of their buildings were repurposed. In 1541, he issued a Letter Patent (a formal royal proclamation) closing down the collegiate church (a sort of mini-cathedral) at Abergwili, in South Wales. He reestablished it 40 miles west in the town of Brecon, giving them the buildings of the now-defunct Dominican friars there. The transplanted organization was given a new name, Christ College Brecon, and a new purpose, running a school. 478 years later, the school is still in operation.</p>
        <h2>The Sources:</h2>
        <p>The original Letter Patent is lost, but the government's original file copy still exists at The National Archives in London. Several other copies were made in the 1700s and 1800s. Except for the file copy, all of the other copies appear as an appendix to a collection of recoreds of St. David's Cathedral. This Letter Patent was printed in an obscure book in 1719.
