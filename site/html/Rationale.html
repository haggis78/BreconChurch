        <h1>Reasons and goals for the project</h1>

        <p>Studying the foundation of Christ College Brecon was a sort of happy accident. I came across the Letters Patent in the course of research into the medieval Statutes of St Davids Cathedral in Wales, which have never been published in full. While the three earliest copies of the Statutes do not include the Brecon charter -- their latest document dates to 1499 -- several others include it as an appendix. Those three earliest copies of the Statutes also share an unfortunate characteristic: they were all damaged in a flood in the early 1700s. This means that any potential edition will have to rely in part on the later copies, particularly those we have designated Witnesses C, D, I, and O. </p>
        <p>Focusing on the Brecon document allowed us to do several things. First, it supplied material for a project through which to practice and refine our coding skills. Second, it provided a case-study through which we could learn more about the relationships among Witnesses C, D, I, and O: because they all date from the same general period and their scribes are anonymous, determining who copied from whom, and how accurately, can only be discovered by analysis of textual relationships. Third, as a pilot project, it required us to establish the digital infrastructure that would be needed if a born-digital edition of the whole of the St Davids Statutes is to be undertaken. And fourth, it serves as a proof of concept that undergraduate students can successfully participate in the technically-demanding task of editing a Latin text in various Early Modern hands, even if they themselves do not know Latin.</p>
        <p>I am grateful for the hard work that my student teammates [INSERT HYPERLINK HERE TO PROJECT TEAM PAGE] put in to make this project a reality.</p>
