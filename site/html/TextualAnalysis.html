      <h1>Analysis of textual relationships among witnesses</h1>
      <h2> Introduction and methodology</h2>
      <p>Thanks to our XML encoding, we can automatically count the frequency with which each
         witness, whether printed or in manuscript, agrees with each other witness. There are
         many different ways in which this could be calculated. We might either include or
         exclude morphological (spelling) differences, or might include some but not others.
         Where a whole phrase is present in some witnesses but absent in others, we might count
         that either as a single point of difference or as one difference per word.
      </p>
      <p>The need for absolute precision is mitigated by the fact that we are not trying to
         generate our stemma in a purely mathematical fashion. Our purpose here is somewhat
         less ambitious: to get an impressionistic sense of the accuracy of scribes, to determine
         which witness or witnesses are closest to the lost original, and to generate hypotheses
         about the relationships among the copies. Such hypotheses can then be checked in the
         conventional way, by looking at individual examples of variations.
      </p>
      <p>Procedurally, it has been simplest to count all variations noted in the XML document,
         whether they are matters of syntax or word choice (vel, seu, and et being interchanged,
         for example); certain spelling differences that we judged to be significant (especially
         different spellings of place names); and words or passages that are present in some
         witnesses and absent in others. Where a whole phrase is absent or present, we have
         encoded that as a single point of difference rather than counting the number of words
         and treating each one as an individual point of difference. By looking at the comparison
         of texts, the reader can quickly see the type of variations we found and identified.
         
      </p>
      <p>We elected from the start to ignore certain other differences, particularly with regard
         to Witness R, the earliest copy we surveyed (the Patent Roll, c. 1541). This copy,
         though technically post-medieval, bore certain characteristics of medieval rather
         than classical/Renaissance-neoclassical Latin. Two in particular stand out. The first
         is the use of -e- alone where classical and neoclassical Latin would use -ae- or the
         ligatured -æ-. (The one time the scribe of R uses -ae- is in the context of the word
         <em>escaetorum</em>; this is a word borrowed from medieval French, apparently imported into English legal
         Latin after other -ae-s had been stripped down to -e-.) The other relates to the appearence
         of -c- or -t- in the middle of a word, especially where followed by an -i-. Not only
         did many medieval scribes interchange these letters: the similarity in their appearance
         in many hands (the c was often made with a horizontal cross-stroke and a separate
         vertical stroke which may or may not include a rightward curve at the bottom, similar
         to the way we write a -t- today) can make it impossible for the modern reader to tell
         which letter the scribe even intended, or even whether the scribe himself had a clear
         idea in each instance which letter he was writing. In the text of R that we prepared
         for comparison with the later witnesses, we re-inserted the -ae- and standardized
         c/t distinction. This is less than ideal in reconstructing the exact morphology and
         syntax of the lost Letter Patent, but because these differences occur so frequently,
         keeping them would have cluttered the data with a great many essentially meaningless
         variant readings (there are over 180 -æ-s and over 400 -ti-s, which together are more
         than double the number of more significant variant readings). Not only would this
         have made numerical differences in the data appear more slight: it would have meant
         tripling the numer of variants marked up in our XML, multiplying the opportunities
         for human error.
      </p>
      <p>Finally, while all of the scribes used various forms of the ampersand rather than
         spelling out the word 'et', we rendered all of these as 'et' in our XML, as is normally
         considered best practice in editing medieval and early modern Latin texts. This meant
         ignoring the handful of times that a scribe wrote out 'et' instead.

         <p>Witnesses D and O: 0</p>
         <p>Witnesses I and O: 197</p>
      </ul>
      <h2>Discussion</h2>
      <p>One finding that immediately springs from this data is that W, S, and J form an independent
         branch of the tree. This was expected, as the citations within these printed witnesses
         themselves establish their dependency: S cites W, and J cites S. W is closest to R,
         S is a bit further, J is further still. This is exactly what we would expect: a certain
         amount of drift as transcription errors crept in. Since the relationship among these
         witnesses was already known, this serves as a successful test of the process of counting
         variants to indicate relationships.
