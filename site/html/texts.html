            over against the first Page of the Statute-Book of this
            Cathedral Church [now N.L.W., SDCh/B/22] that in the year 1719
            the said Statute-Book was collated by the late Bishop Ottley
            &amp; the late Mr. Chantor Davies with a much more ancient
            manuscript of the said Statutes [now British Library, Harley MS
            6280], which was attested A[nn]o 1588 by Bishop Middleton,
            Chantor Huett &amp; c., &amp; which said ancient Copy has ever
            since been unfortunately missing (which is greatly lamented) or
            at least was never seen by any of the present members of the
            Chapter; -Richard Davies Archdeacon of St. Davids &amp; one of
            the Canons Residentiary of this Church made many Enquiries with
            various Persons and in various places, in order to the
            recovering, if possible, the said ancient manuscript: and
            particularly haveing procured diligent search to be made for
            that purpose among the Books and Papers of the said late Mr.
            Chantor Davies, altho' the Book in question could not, upon such
            serch, be found, yet the present manuscript (containing not only
            the St. Davids Statutes, but also the Patent of King Henry the
            Eighth for founding Christ's College in Brecon) being met with
            among the said Books, was, at the Request of the said

            of Arts, Golden Prebendary of this Church [NB he held the preb.

         <p><b>Original Date of Manuscript:</b></p>
         <p>Before May 1740.</p>
         <p><b>Source Description:</b></p>
         <p>
            Origin unknown. This is the principal copy consulted by Edward
            Yardley in compiling _Menevia Sacra_. This can be determined by
            the fact that the page numbers he supplies in his marginal
            notations (rendered as footnotes in the publication by editor
            Francis Green) align with the page numbers in this manuscript.
            Yardley's partial transcript of the Brecon charter on p. 415 of
            _Menevia Sacra_ references 'Ex libro Episcopi Menev., Stat.
            Menev., p. 269. Compare this with ye same Charter printed in B.
            Willis, Abb. Vol. ii, p. 304.' (The printing to which Yardley refers is our Witness
            W.) The document in question begins
            on p. 269 in only one manuscript, indicating that Yardley was referring to this copy.
            More fully, Yardley's digest of
            the statutes (National Library of Wales, MS SDCh/B/31, not
            published by Green) has page references throughout, which again
            align with the page numbers in this manuscript. A note on p. iii of Yardley's digest
            is our only
            indication of this manuscript's date: he wrote  that it was 'Abridg'd from a Copy
            of ye Statutes in the Possession of ye Rt Revd Nicholas [Clagett] Ld Bp of St Davids,
            lent me by his Lordship, May 1740'.Before May 1740.. Remains in the legal ownership of
            the Dean and Chapter of St Davids; placed on deposit at National
            Library of Wales.

            throughout.
            
         </p>
         <p><b>Original Date of Manuscript:</b></p>
         <p>Probably before 1729.</p>
         <p><b>Source Description:</b></p>
         <p>
            Origin unknown. Two letters are pasted in among foreleaves. One
            from Bishop Adam Ottley (bishop of St Davids 1713-23) mentions
            borrowing a copy of the Statutes from Robert Harley, 1st Earl of
            Oxford. This may in fact refer to the MS that is now
            Harley 6280, though that seems unlikely. Ottley used Harley 6280 to check National
            Library of
            Wales, MS SDCh/B/22 in 1719, but it is not clear that Harley had come into possession
            of that manuscript yet. The other letter is from his successor,
            Richard Smallbrook (bishop of St Davids 1724-1731) in 1729,
            promising to return to Edward Harley, 2nd Earl of Oxford, a copy
            of the statutes (either Harley 6280 or this present volume)
            which he had borrowed to use in a suit in the Court of Arches to
            oblige canons of St Davids to residence. Harley 6280 was in the
            hands of Thomas Baker at Cambridge at an unknown date between
            1719 and his death in 1740 (Bodleian Library, Willis MS. 38 f.
            531r-v), and again, it may not have entered Harley's collection yet. It may be that
            Harley 1249 was thus the only copy
            Harley had to lend to Smallbrook at this time. Moreover, both Ottley and Smallbrook
            should have recognized that Harley 6280 properly belonged to the cathedral chapter,
            while Harley 1249 bears no marks that it belonged to anyone other than Harley. A letter
            of thanks for a loan with a promise to return a book would make sense if the book
            was 1249 but not 6280.
            Probably before 1729.

            Produced by Chancery, the office that issued and enrolled Letters Patent. The 'original'
            from which it was copied was not the Letter Patent that had been issued, but rather
            the Warrant in Chancery, the authorised draft from which the Letter itself was prepared.
            This may survive in The National Archives in the file C 82/776, which contains the
            surviving Warrants in Chancery for January of 32 Henry VIII (1541), but we have not
            been able to examine it at this time. Though the Letters Patent establishing Brecon
            were issued in January of 32 Henry VIII (1540 Old Style, 1541 New Style), the document
            was not enrolled in the Patent Rolls until 33 Henry VIII, confirming that it must
            have been copied from the Warrant in Chancery, which they would still have had, and
            not the Letters Patent, which had already been sent out (for details of the process,
            see https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015008927983&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=1). The
            Patent Rolls were initially stored in the Rolls Chapel in the
            Tower of London. The were then moved to the new Public Record Office building
            in Chancery Lane in the 1850s and thence to the second Public
            Record Office building in Kew in the 1990s. The Public Record
            Office became The National Archives in 2003. 
            33 Henry VIII (1541-1542).
